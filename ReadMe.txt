I created two programs for this challenge.
The first PeopleDataGenerator.cs uses a list of common names and min/max ints 
to create a set of 100 randomized people with random birth and death dates.
It outputs the data into a text file.

Second is PopulationCalculator.cs which takes the outputted text file generated by the first script.
Parses the data into an array, then goes through and counts the population of each year.
It outputs the year with the highest population.

People.txt is the data generated from PeopleDataGenerator.cs that I used for this test.

Output.txt is an example of the console output from PopulationCalculator.cs.

PopulationPerYear.txt is a breakdown of the data, showing the population per year.
It is not outputted from the scripts.
